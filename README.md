# Weather Analysis Web Page

In this repository, I built a fully responve Web Visualization Dashboard for weather data across the world. The website is complete with 7 scalable pages including:

- A landing page
- Pages for each of the plotted graphs
- A Page that compares all 4 plots
- A Page for the data that was used
